I post some of my writtings to record my growth. Some of them are drafts(not typed by latex), but I think it's still useful (I may type them in latex if I have time).


- **Physical picture of tensor products and direct sum:** [link](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/file/Physical picture of tensor products and direct sum.pdf)
Tensor products and direct sums of vector spaces are abstract concepts
in linear algebra. In this article, we aim to elucidate these abstrct notions
by developing into the physical manifestations of two systems: the 1/2-
spin system and the two -particle system.


- **Visualizasion for π1(SO(3)/D2) and rotation of eigenvectors:**[link](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/file/visualizasion of fundmental group of SO(3)D2(6).pdf) In this article we will visualize SO(3)/D2 and π1(SO(3)/D2) to obtain a nice picture describing rotation of eigenframes.


- **My Talks in Small workshop about several topics about geometry and topology, 24 summer:**[link](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/writtingtalks/Small workshop about several topics about geometry and topology) It contains the following topics: sheaf theory, when do we have k-spectral bundles, how to tell a fiber bundle is trivial, introduction to stratified vector bundles, blow up and smoothness in algebraic geometry.

- **Notes on Higgs bundles**还未上传

- **Differential geometry of vector bundles(ch III in gtm65):**[link](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/file/Diff. geo. of vec. bundles.pdf) It introduces connections, curvatures and Chern classes in analysis version.

- **Notes on fiber bundles:**[link](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/file/fiber bundle.pdf) It introduces fiber bundles, principal bundles, classification of principal bundles and characteristic classes including Chern classes, Stiefel -Whitney classes, and Pontrjagin classes. It's the note for ch3,4 of this **[lecture notes](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MAT4540/h23/754notes-1.pdf)**
