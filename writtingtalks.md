I post some of my writtings to record my growth. Some of them are drafts(not typed by latex), but I think it's still useful (I may type them in latex if I have time).

- **[Physical picture of tensor products and direct sum:]**(https://JoZhouFang.github.io/file/Physical picture of tensor products and direct sum.pdf)
Tensor products and direct sums of vector spaces are abstract concepts
in linear algebra. In this article, we aim to elucidate these abstrct notions
by developing into the physical manifestations of two systems: the 1/2-
spin system and the two -particle system.

- **[Notes on algebraic geometry]()**: Notes for Gathmann's algebraic geometry. It's more detailed and organized more reasonable. Besides, I plugging some useful comment here.这里要改这里要改这里要改

- **[Talk: Sheaf theory(ch II)](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/file/sheaf theory.pdf)** : Notes for gtm65 chII, it's about presheaves/sheaves, resolution of sheaves, cohomolgy theory and cech cohomology. It's more detailed (so more friendly) than gtm65.

- **[Talk: When do we have k-spectral bundles?]()**

- **[Talk: How to tell a fiber bundle is trivial?]()**

- **[Talk: Introduction to stratified vector bundles](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/file/Introduction to stratified vector bundles.pdf)**

- **[Notes on Higgs bundles]()**这里要改这里要改这里要改

- **[differential geometry of vector bundles(ch III)]()**: 这里要改这里要改这里要改
