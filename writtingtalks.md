I post some of my writtings to record my growth. Some of them are drafts(not typed by latex), but I think it's still useful (I may type them in latex if I have time).

- **[Physical picture of tensor products and direct sum:]**(https://JoZhouFang.github.io/file/Physical picture of tensor products and direct sum.pdf)
Tensor products and direct sums of vector spaces are abstract concepts
in linear algebra. In this article, we aim to elucidate these abstrct notions
by developing into the physical manifestations of two systems: the 1/2-
spin system and the two -particle system.
