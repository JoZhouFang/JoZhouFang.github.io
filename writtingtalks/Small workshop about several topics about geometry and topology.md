#  My Talks in Small workshop about several topics about geometry and topology, 24 summer

- **[Sheaf theory](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/writtingtalks/file_wt/sheaf theory.pdf)** : Notes for gtm65 chII, it's about presheaves/sheaves, resolution of sheaves, cohomolgy theory and cech cohomology. It's more detailed (so more friendly) than gtm65.

- **[When do we have k-spectral bundles?](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/writtingtalks/file_wt/When do we have k-spectral bundles.pdf)**

- **[How to tell a fiber bundle is trivial?](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/writtingtalks/file_wt/How to tell a fiber bundle is trivial.pdf)**

- **[Introduction to stratified vector bundles](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/writtingtalks/file_wt/Introduction to stratified vector bundles.pdf)**
