#  My Talks in Small workshop about several topics about geometry and topology, 24 summer

It's a small workshop because the participants are only Chenlu Huang and me, held in 24 Summer online. This workshop focus on several topics about geometry and topology.

- **Sheaf theory**[link](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/writtingtalks/file_wt/sheaf theory.pdf) : Notes for gtm65 chII, it's about presheaves/sheaves, resolution of sheaves, cohomolgy theory and cech cohomology. It's more detailed (so more friendly) than gtm65.

- **When do we have k-spectral bundles?**[link](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/writtingtalks/file_wt/When do we have k-spectral bundles.pdf)

- **How to tell a fiber bundle is trivial?**[link](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/writtingtalks/file_wt/How to tell a fiber bundle is trivial.pdf)

- **Introduction to stratified vector bundles**[link](https://JoZhouFang.github.io/writtingtalks/file_wt/Introduction to stratified vector bundles.pdf)
